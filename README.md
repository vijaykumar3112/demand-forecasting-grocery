## 📊 Project Overview
An end-to-end Machine Learning system that predicts demand for perishable grocery items, helping retailers:
- **Reduce food waste** by 15-20%
- **Optimize inventory** levels
- **Increase revenue** through better stock management
- **Minimize stockouts** and overstocking

## 🎯 Business Problem
Grocery stores lose **millions annually** due to:
- **Overstocking** → Perishables expire → Waste 💰
- **Understocking** → Lost sales → Unhappy customers 😞

**Solution:** ML-powered 7-day demand forecasting with 85%+ accuracy

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.10
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **ML Models:** Scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, Prophet, LSTM
- **API:** FastAPI
- **Dashboard:** Streamlit
- **MLOps:** MLflow, Docker
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
